 Notes
Different tools should be installed before using the app:

Python Anaconda ( Can be QuickResquested in support.mmc.com/ )
Selenium browser Driver: Can be downloade from here: https://pypi.org/project/selenium/. Choose the Browser you commonly use and its version. The path where the file is located should be inputted into the PATH field in the tool
Run the requirements.txt to install all the necessary libraries
Is possible that the HTML structure of the survey page change. In case the tool stops working it might mean that the code need slight changes.
